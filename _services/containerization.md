I am pretty sure that you were in trouble at least once during a software release because the dev and production environments had differences. Packaging your apps into [Docker](https://www.docker.com/){:target="_blank"} containers can help you to eliminate these possible troubles. Using a microservices based architecticture not only helps but requires the usage of containers. We recommend to use the industrial standard orchestrators for your containers such as [Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs "Amazon Elastic Container Service"){:target="_blank"} or any [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/pick-right-solution/ "Kubernetes - Picking the right solution"){:target="_blank"} solution.
