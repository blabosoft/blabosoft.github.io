title: Legacy code migration
---

You may have an awsome (monolith) software, but it is quite old, you can find nobody to modify a feature and deploy it without causing issues in production. It's a classic story, but the show must go on. We can help you to migrate either small features or the entire applications to a fresh code base using state-of-the-art technology staying within reasonable costs. It requires understanding every aspects of the legacy code and we have great experience in it (for .NET, Python and frontend stacks). **We can ensure your business could seamlessly run even for decades.**
